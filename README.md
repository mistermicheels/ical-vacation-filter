# ical-vacation-filter

Take an Outlook iCal feed and keep only the out-of-office events.

Filtered feed URL: `https://ical-vacation-filter.herokuapp.com/filter?source=%source_feed_URL%`.

It is recommended to encode the source feed URL using EncodeURIComponent.

Note: If you struggle to get your favourite calendar software to subscribe to the resulting feed URL, try putting the URL behind a URL shortener.

## Suggestions for improvement

-   Add frontend that turns source feed URL into copyable filtered feed URL
-   Add automated tests
